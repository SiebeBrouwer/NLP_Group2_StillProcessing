# NLP_Group-2_Still-Processing
This is the NLP exam project GitHub repository for Group 2: Still Processing... 
In this repository, you can find our code, paper and powerpoint presentation prepared for this class.

The 'NLP_Project.zip' file contains all datasets used for as train and test data for this project.
  
The 5 Pickled RoBERTas used in the code can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X3Pkv0M6XcSism_YtZJVY706Xi2MzJbb/view?usp=sharing
  
The code file containing all code used can be found under the name '\_\_NLP_Project.ipynb', it contains code written to be used in a google collaborate document within a file called 'NLP_Project' with the pathname: 'drive/MyDrive/NLP2022/NLP_Project'. If you would like to assert the code for yourself, the easiest option would be to download the dataset file 'NLP_Project.zip' to a drive containing the abovementioned path and upload the code as well as the 5 pickled RoBERTas to that file as well. 

Lastly, both our paper and presentation, explaining our research and code can be found under the names 'NLP_Project_paper' and 'NLP_Project_presentation' respectively.
